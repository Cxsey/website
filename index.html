 <h1>Brawl Stars is a worthy, if simple, Clash Royale successor</h1>

<h2>Supercell’s latest offers free, frantic fun well-suited to touchscreens and quick-hit play</h2>

 <a>For a while there, it seemed like Brawl Stars wasn’t going to make it.<br> Supercell’s free-to-play mobile shooter soft-launched in<br> Canada in June 2017 and then reached a few more countries this<br> past January, but the lethargic rollout suggested that Brawl Stars wasn’t<br> ready to join the likes of Clash Royale and Clash of Clans as an<br> international smash.</a>
 <stil><br><br>

   <a>BRAWL STARS IS <br>COGNIZANT OF THE<br> PLATFORM’S <br>LIMITATIONS</a>
 <br><br><br>

<bull>
 <a>Its creators agreed, apparently. During its 500-plus days in limited<br> release, the Finnish studio reworked the controls and progression<br> system, shifted the screen orientation, and made myriad other tweak.<br> Supercell has a history of killing soft-launched games that couldn’t<br> match its vision, but Brawl Stars finally emerged from the gauntlet<br> alive, and seemingly better for having gone through it.</a><br><br>

<stars>

<a>Brawl Stars smartly adapts team-based multiplayer shooters for mobile in a way that<br> makes perfect sense for pocket-sized touch devices. It’s an objective-based shooter, a<br> battle royale game, a MOBA-lite and more, all wrapped up in an approachable<br> and attractive package.</a><br><br>



<doom>
<a>Both Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s<br> Battlegrounds have been huge on iOS and<br> Android (and everywhere else) this year,<br> but neither is an optimal smartphone<br> experience. They are certainly good enough<br> if you don’t have a current console or a<br> capable PC, or you’re just hungry for competition on the go, but they’re awkward in all<br> of the ways you’d expect from a mobile port. They’re cumbersome and imprecise, and<br> don’t run as well as on older devices. The oft-lengthy matches also aren’t ideal for<br> hopping in for a quick fix.</a><br><br>


<a>Brawl Stars doesn’t suffer from these problems, because it’s built for mobile and<br> cognizant of the platform’s limitations. Matches typically last a couple of minutes, and<br> the top-down view means there’s no fussing with a camera. One virtual stick controls<br> your character while another aims and fires your weapon; you can alternately tap the<br> latter stick for a single shot at the nearest foe. And once your special attack charges,<br> another virtual stick activates to aim and launch that.</a><br><br>

  <a>That’s all there is to it. It works impressively well: Movement and aiming both feel<br> spot-on, and there’s essentially no learning curve to contend with. The matches are fast<br> and fluid, and pretty satisfying despite their compact length. They’ll get your heart<br> pumping too; I’ve already cursed aloud (to myself) at many random opponents (who<br> can’t hear me) when gunned down in the heat of battle.</a><br><br>
  
  <a>Gem Grab is the core Brawl Stars experience, a three-on-three offering in which<br> gleaming, purple gems pop out of a hole in the center of the stage. Each team vies to be<br> the first to claim 10 gems, then hold firm as the timer ticks down. But a well-timed<br> shotgun blast or luchador elbow drop will scatter the defeated player’s stash, quickly<br> turning the tide in this entertaining mode.</a><br><br>

  <a>More play options emerge as you gradually accumulate trophies. Showdown is Brawl<br> Stars’ 10-player take on the battle royale, and is available in both solo and duos<br> variants. It’s pretty straightforward: you’ll fire away at foes and try to survive, but the<br> strategic twist comes with health and attack-boosting power cubes scattered in<br> treasure boxes around the stage. In familiar battle royale fashion, the play area<br> gradually shrinks over time — here, it’s with poison clouds that creep from the edges<br> towards the center of the map.</a><br><br>

  <a>Bounty mode is like team deathmatch, with bonus points for taking out opponents<br> with long kill streaks, while the MOBA-esque Heist sends your team off to destroy the<br> enemies’ safe before they eradicate yours. Brawl Ball is … well, it’s soccer with guns.<br> That’s pretty amusing.</a><br><br>

  <a>The cartoonish look is sharp throughout, from the level backdrops to the characters<br> themselves, with a solid mix of play styles found within the currently 22-strong hero<br> roster. An Elvis-esque cowboy with powerful pistols that must be precisely aimed? A<br> robot bartender who lobs explosive bottles for ample splash damage? How about a<br> hero who can summon a lumbering bear to hunt down foes? They’re all here.<a><br><br>

   <a>Granted, the characters don’t pack much personality beyond their vibrant looks, but<br> the diversity in attack and attribute cocktails keeps things interesting. The heroes feel<br> different on the battlefield, and you can quickly sense when some are a better fit for<br> play modes over others, or that a complementary team pairing makes for a more<br> effective unit in battle</a>

  <a>A WELCOME ARRAY OF<br> DISTINCTIVE PLAY MODES<br> AND CHARACTERS</a>
<div class="round">
  <max><br><br>
    <a>Brawl Stars’ diverse array of genre riffs keeps things<br> lively, and like Supercell’s older Clash Royale, this free-to<br>-play game is very fairly monetized. You can play as<br> much as you want with no timers to wait (or pay)<br> through, but you’ll only earn item box-unlocking tokens<br> for your first handful of matches of a long session. Beyond that, you’ll have to wait for<br> the tokens to recharge before earning any further rewards.</a><br><br>

    <a>Even amidst a welcome array of distinctive play modes and characters, Brawl Stars<br> sticks to the same basic gameplay elements throughout. It’s what helps keep the action<br> so immediate and approachable, and it’s a large part of why Supercell’s latest game<br> succeeds.</a><br><br>

    <a>That also could be what ultimately limits its long-term appeal, however. Brawl Stars<br> has been streamlined to dramatic effect, but there’s little depth to the moment-to<br>-moment gameplay. It doesn’t have the kind of strategic hook and outside-the-game<br> tinkering that made Clash Royale such a worthy obsession and, eventually, a proper<br> esport. Supercell may well have competitive ambitions for Brawl Stars too, but I just<br> don’t see enough tactical potential here to yield something that people would bother to<br> watch. In time, that same level of simplicity could make initially excited players peel<br> away in favor of fresher mobile distractions.</a><br><br>

    <a>But who knows? Given how much time Supercell spent tinkering with Brawl Stars<br> before launch, it seems fair to assume that the studio may put the same kind of effort<br> into keeping the game lively and engaging for the long haul. Even if not, Brawl Stars is<br> a bite-sized treat that you can savor for free right now, and it feels just right on your<br> smartphone.</a><br><br><br><br><br><br>
